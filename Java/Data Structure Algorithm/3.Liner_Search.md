# Liner Search

Liner search is a very basic and simple search algorithm. In Liner search, we search an element or value in a given array by traversing the array from the starting, till the desired element or value is found.

It compares the element to be searched with all the elements present in the array and when the element is matched successfully, it returns the index of the element in the array, else it return -1.

Liner search is applied on unsorted or unordered lists, where there are fewer elements in a list.

## Features of Linear Search Algorithm

1. It is used for unsorted and unordered small list of elements.
2. It has a time complexity of O(n), which means the time is linearly dependent on the number of elements, which is not bad, but not good too.
3. It has very simple implementation.

## Implementing Liner Search

1. Traverse the array using a **for** loop.
2. In every iteration, compare the target value with the current value of the array.
   * If the value match, return the current index of the array.
   * If the values do not match, move on to the next array element.
3. If no match is found, return -1.

```java
public int linerSearch(int values[], int target)
{
    if(values == null)
        return -1;

    for(int i=0; i<values.length; i++)
    {
        if(values[i] == target)
            return i;
    }

    return -1;
}
```

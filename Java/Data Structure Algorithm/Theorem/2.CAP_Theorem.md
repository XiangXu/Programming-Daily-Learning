# CAP Theorem

In theoretical computer science, the CPA theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that **it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees**:

* **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
* **Availability**: Every request receives a (non-error) response, withouth guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
* **Partition tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped or delayed by the network between nodes.

When a network partition failure happens should we decide to

* Cancel the operation thus decrease the availability but ensure consistency.
* Proceed with the operation and thus provide availability but risk consistency.

## Explanation

**No distributed syste is safe from network failures, thus network partitioning generally has to be tolerance**. In the presence of a partition, **one is then left with two options: consistency or availability**.

**When choosing consistency over availability, the system will return an error or a time out if particular information cannot be guaranteed to be update to date due to network partitioning**.

**When choosing availability over consistency, the system will always process the query and try to return the most recent available version of the inforamtion, even if cannot guarantee it is up to date due to network partitioning**.

In the absence of network failure – that is, when the distributed system is running normally – both availability and consistency can be satisfied.

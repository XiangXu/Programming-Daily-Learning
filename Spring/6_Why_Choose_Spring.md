# Why Choose Spring as Your Java Application

## Why Use Any Framework

Pros:
* Help us **focus on the core task rather than bolierplate** associated with it.
* Brings together years of wisdom in the form of design patterns.
* Helps us adhere to the industry and regulatory standards.
* Brings down the total cost of ownership for the application.

Cons:
* Forces us to **write application in a specific manner**.
* Binds to a specific version of language and libraries.
* Adds to the resource footprint of the application.

## Spring Framework

* **Core**: Provides core features like DI(Dependency Injection), Internationalisation, Validation and AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming).
* **Data Access**: Supports data access through JTA(Java transaction API), JPA(Java Persistence API), and JDBC(Java Database Connectivity).
* **Integration**: Supports integration to Enterprise Java through JMS(Java Message Service), JMX(Java Management Extension), and RMI(Remote Method Invocation).
* **Testing**: Wide support for unit and integration testing though Mock objects, Test Fixtures, Context Management, and Caching.

## So, Why Choose Spring?

* **Usability**: It is really easy for developers to start and then configure exactly what they need.
* **Modularity**: We can optionally include one or more Sprong projects depending upon the need.
* **Conformance(一致性)**: Although Spring does not support all of Jakarta EE specifications, it supports all of its technologies, often improving the support over the standard specification where necessary. For instance, Spring supports JPA based repositories and hence makes it trivial to switch providers.

# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which **the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations**. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers. In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the list.

## Circular Linked List

**Circular Linked List is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle**. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked or doubly circular linked list.

## Doubly Linked List

**A Doubly Linked List contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with the next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list**.

# What's the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?

## HTTP: No Data Encryption Implemented

Every URL link that begins with HTTP uses a basic type of **"hypertext transfer protocol"**. This network protocol standard is what allows web browser and server to communicate through the exchange data.

HTTP is also called "a stateless system", which means that it enables connection on demand. You click a link, requesting a connection, and your browser sends this request to the server, which responds by opening the page. The quicker the connection is, the faster the data is presented to you.

As an "application layer protocol", HTTP remains focused on presenting the information, but cares less about the way this information travels from one place to another. Unfortunately, this means that **HTTP can be intercepted and potentially alerted**, making both the information and the information receiver vulnerable.

## HTTPS: Encrypted Connections

HTTPS is not the opposite of HTTP, but its younger cousin. The two are essentially the same, in that both of them refer to the same "hypertext transfer protocol" that enables requested web data to be presented on your screen. But, HTTPS is still slightly different, more advanced, and much more secure.

Simply put, HTTPS protocol is an extension of HTTP. That "S" in the abbreviation comes fomr the word Secure and it is powered by Transport Layer Security(TSL) - the successor to Secure Sockets Layer(SSL), the standard security technology that establishes an encrypted connection between a web server and a browser.

Without HTTPS, any data you enter into the site(such as username/password, credit card or bank details, any other form submission data, etc.) will be sent plaintext and therefore susceptible to interception or eavesdropping(偷听). For this reason, you should always check that a site is using HTTPS before you enter any information.

**In addation to encrypting the data transmitted between the server and your browser, TLS also authenticates the server you are connecting to and protects that transmitted data from tampering(干预)**.

It helps me to think about it like this - HTTP in HTTPS is the equivalent of a destination, while TSL/SSL is the equivalent of a jounary. The first is responsible for getting data to your screen, and the second manages the way it gets there. With joint forces, they move data in a safe fashion.

## The Advantages of Using HTTPS

The security benefits metioned above - a**uthenticating the server, encrypting data transmission, and protecting the exchange from tampering** - are the obvious main advantages to using HTTPS. Site operator want and need to protect their visitors data(HTTPS is actually a requiremnt for any sites collecting payment information according to the PCI Data Security Standard) and visitors want to know that their data is being transmitted securely.

The growing demand for data privacy and security from the general public is another advantage to using HTTPS. In fact, according to We Make Websites, 13% of all cart abandonment is due to payment security concerns. Site visitors want to know that they can trust your site, especially if they are entering financial details, and using HTTPS is one way to do that (i.e. it’s one way to show your visitors that any information they enter will be encrypted).

HTTPS can also help with your SEO. Back in 2014, Google announced HTTPS as a ranking signal. Since then, some studies and anecdotal experience from companies who have implemented HTTPS indicate a correlation to higher rankings and page visibility.

Browsers are also jumping in on efforts to increase HTTPS usage by implementing UI changes that will negatively affect non-HTTPS sites. For example, Google announced earlier this year that Chrome by July (only a few months from now!) that they will mark all HTTP sites as non-secure.

Firefox has also announced plans to flag HTTP sites. Imagine the impact of this on your brand-building and marketing, your customer acquisition and sales. The only way to face the incoming change is by embracing it - get HTTPS on your site!

# Computer Network

## Terms

**LAN**: local area network is a group of computers and network devices connected together, usually within the same building.

**MAN**: metropolitan area network is a larger network that usually spans several buildings in the same city or town.

**WAN**: wide area network, in comparison to a MAN, is not restricted to a geographical location, although it might be confined within the bounds of a state or country. A WAN connects several LANs, and may be limited to an enterprise (a corporation or an organization) or accessible to the public. The technology is high speed and relatively expensive. The Internet is an example of a worldwide public WAN.

**Router**: A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. 

**Hub->Bridge->Switch**: A switch is is designed to connect computer within a network.

**Subnet Mask(子网掩码)**: It is a 32 bit number that masks IP address, and divides the IP address into network address and host address. 

**IP**: An Internet Protocol address is also known as IP address. It is a numerical label which assigned to each device connected to a computer network which use the IP for communicaiton. 

**MAC(Media Access Control ) Address**: it is a unique identifier assigned to network interface controller for use as a network address in communicaiton within a network segment.

**DNS(Domain Name System)**: The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. 

**NFS(Network File System)**: it allows a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed. 

**SNMP(Simple Network Management Protocol)**: it is an Internet Standard protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP network and for modifying that information to change device behavior. 


## Data-rate Units

Speed:  
**1kb/s** = 10<sup>3</sup>b/s  
1Mb/s = 10<sup>3</sup>kb/s = 10<sup>6</sup>b/s  
1Gb/s = 10<sup>3</sup>Mb/s = 10<sup>6</sup>kb/s = 10<sup>9</sup>b/s  
1Tb/s = 10<sup>3</sup>Gb/s = 10<sup>6</sup>Mb/s = 10<sup>9</sup>kb/s = 10<sup>12</sup>b/s 

Memory:  
**1KB** = 1024B = 1024 * 8b   
1MB = 2<sup>10</sup>KB = 1024KB  
1GB = 1024MB  
1TB = 1024GB
